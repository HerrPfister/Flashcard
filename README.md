# Flashcard

A simple `flashcard` component to demonstrate storybook and the css flip animation.

> This is an example for a [DEV article](https://dev.to/herrpfister/storybook-experience-your-components-in-isolation-e61) that I wrote. However, it is still a fully functional component. Use it however you want!

## How to use?

```tsx
<div>
    <Flashcard Back="This is the back of the card." Front="This is the front of the card." />
    <Flashcard Back={<Typography>This is a styled card back</Typography>} Front={<Typography>This is a styled card front</Typography>} />
</div>
```
